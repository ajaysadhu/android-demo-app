# Road Warrior Mobile Android Application

This project is envisioned to run on Car Dashboard, Camera mounted vehicles with clear visibility for the app to view the road. 
This App runs a Live Camera and behind the scenes analyze the feed with our custom made model that detects Potholes, Cracks, Uneven, Abnormal road conditions and sends the required non user specific data to Road Warriror Servers. The data contains UserID, RoadScreenshot, Geo Location, Time. Such data will be shared on open domain for viewers and volunteers to give a supporting hand try to do their best in fixing the problem.
